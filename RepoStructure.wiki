The [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion] repository for the !DelphiDabbler Component and Unit Library is structured as follows:

|| <pre>branches</pre> || Unused at present. ||
|| <pre>tags</pre> || Contains copies of all stable releases. ||
|| <pre>  lib</pre> || Unused at present. Reserved for any releases of whole library. Each release will have its own sub-directory named `release-x.x.x` where `x.x.x` is the release version number. ||
|| <pre>  projects</pre> || Contains stable releases of each sub-project. ||
|| <pre>    <project-id></pre> || Contains stable releases of a sub-project. There is a separate directory for each sub-project whose name is the ID of the sub-project. ||
|| <pre>      <release></pre> || Contains a stable release of the sub-project. There is a separate directory for each release named `release-x.x.x` where `x.x.x` is the release version number. ||
|| <pre>      ...</pre> ||  ||
|| <pre>    ...</pre> ||  ||
