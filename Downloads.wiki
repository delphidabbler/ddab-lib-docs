=Downloads=

Following Google's decision to discontinue the download service in January 2014, all the download files from this project have now been moved to _!SourceForge_.

Downloads can now be accessed via the _!SourceForge_ [https://sourceforge.net/projects/ddablib/files/ File Manager].

Each of the library's sub-projects has its own directory in the File Manager where its releases are stored. These are as follows:

Note that all downloads that were on _!GoogleCode_ as of 2nd November 2013 have been left in place so that any links will still work. However no further library releases after that date will have been uploaded.
