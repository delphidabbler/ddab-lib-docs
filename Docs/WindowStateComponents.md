| _[TPJWdwState](TPJWdwState.md)_ | Saves and restores window position and state to and from an ini file. |
| _[TPJRegWdwState](TPJRegWdwState.md)_ | Saves and restores window position and state to and from the registry. |
| _[TPJUserWdwState](TPJUserWdwState.md)_ | Saves and restores window position and state to and from user-provided persistent storage. |

Various event handler procedural types, oridinal types and set types are also defined.
