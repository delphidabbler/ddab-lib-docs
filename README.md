# DelphiDabbler Code Library Documentation

> ***THIS REPO IS MOVING***
>
> A new *DelphiDabbler Code Library Documentation* website is being developed. It can be found at <https://lib-docs.delphidabbler.com>.
>
> The website's source code is available in the [`ddablib/ddablib.github.io`](https://github.com/ddablib/ddablib.github.io) GitHub repository. The website is being developed from a copy of this repository's code base.
>
> The code in the new repo is being restructured to better suit the website format *and* to enable documentation for different major versions of a library project to coexist.
>
> Restructuring is taking place one project at a time. As each project's documentation is completed that section of the website will replace the documentation here. Once the restructuring of the website code has been completed, this repository will be archived.

The DelphiDabbler Code Library contains various useful and re-usable Delphi components, units and IDE extensions, arranged in sub-projects. All were originally published on [DelphiDabbler.com](https://delphidabbler.com/).

Many of the components and classes are stable and have been in development for a number of years. For details of each sub-project see [this summary](Docs/Welcome.md).

The project contains these components, classes and IDE extensions:

The **Source Code Repo** column contains a link to the project's Git repository.

The **Documentation** column contains links to the projects documentation. _Here_ links to documentation within this repository, while _Website_ links to a page on <https://lib-docs.delphidabbler.com>.

The **Releases** column contains links to the project's directory on the *SourceForge* file manager from where zip files containing all available releases can be downloaded. There are also links to the project's _Releases_ page on GitHub, which has only later releases available.

The **More Info** column has links that take you to the library project's page on DelphiDabbler.com.

The **Platforms** column notes the platforms that the project is compatible with. *Win32* is 32 bit Windows and *Win64* is 64 bit Windows. Struck out items, like *<strike>Win64</strike>*, indicate that the code is not compatible with the platform. IDE extensions are only ever 32 bit compatible. **Note:** No projects in this library have been tested on non-Windows platforms.

The **Framework** column notes whether the project is compatible with either the VCL or FireMonkey, has no dependencies, or is an IDE extension. The following abbreviations are used:

  * *RTL* - requires only the Delphi run time library, so has no dependencies on either the VCL and FMX frameworks and can be used with either or none.
  * *VCL* - compatible with the Visual Component Library framework.
  * *FMX* - compatible with the FireMonkey framework.
  * *IDE* - an IDE extension.

Struck out frameworks such as *<strike>FMX</strike>* are not supported by the project.

## About this documentation

### A little history

The documentation started out as a wiki on Google Code, maintained in a Subversion repository as a branch of the DelphiDabbler Code Library Project. The wiki branch was extracted from the Subversion repository and converted to Git as at commit 1d1404b. The Git repository was placed on GitHub in the `delphidabbler/ddab-lib-docs` project.

Development continued directly on the `master` branch until commit 39b9e5a when the GitFlow development model was adopted.

Development then took place on a `develop` branch. Five releases were made before the GitFlow model was abandoned at commit 0697fcb. The `develop` branch was deleted at commit 979f604 and all the release tags were deleted. The associated change-log file was also removed.

### Development model

Since commit 979f604 a new development model was adopted. Changes are now made on branches off `master` and merged back into `master` once verified.
